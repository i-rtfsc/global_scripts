# Treat everything not text if not specified
# Avoid crlf messing up things like .asset and ProjectSettings (But we'd like to diff so we do not assign binary[-text -diff] tag)
# You should never do line ending conversion on .asset, .asset could be CRLF(ProjectSettings) LF(Tile set config) or binary even if forced text(Lighting and Terrain Data)
